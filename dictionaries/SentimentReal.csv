Especially men in leadership positions are prone to abuse their power. However, it is not exculsively a male phenomenon - abuse was also frequently committed by nuns in orphanages of the Catholic Church. Only safeguarding policies, internal and external control as well as strict transparency procedures help. Ethical organisations could also pay part of their salaries as conditional bonus or additional pension which is forfeited in case of certain unethical  behaviour. In case of criminal behaviour legal procedures and investigations should be actively supported.",1

Now suddenly they are tangled up in a scandals involving their employees.. this isn't about concern for what happened. Indeed the story was in the public domain somewhat as the charity commission has a whif of it though not all. This is out because Oxfam upset some powerful people with their report and these people are now out to dismantle what is essentially one of the most powerful campaigners for social justice. Someone went digging for the right scandal and they found one. 
If Oxfam goes under there won't be anyone bothering the fat cats conscience... this is the same  things they are doing to the NHS... 

When a Doctor abuses patients the Government doesn't close the hospital, when a head teacher abuses children the Government doesn't withdraw funding from the school nor did we see the BBC deprived of tax cash because of the Jimmy Saville Scandal.

Very few organisations and leaders are brave enough to admit their problems and weaknesses and crimes committed by their people. Many will resort to ""white washing"" and cover-up just to protect the image of the organization. But Oxfam didn't resort to those options and bravely face the issue and stayed true to their advocacy of protecting women and the vulnerable sectors. And have those who committed the offense accountable so that justice be served to the offended.

It is never fair to condemn a whole organization with thousands of extra ordinary staff doing significant humanitarian work around the globe due mainly to the faults of some few greedy individuals who happens to work with OXFAM. 
OXFAM does not only help alleviate the sufferings of the communities affected by disasters and other injustice all over the world, their staffs (mostly hired locally) are equally empowered as well, in several ways. 
 In fact, I was one of the many who have realized the importance of a humanitarian work when OXFAM gave me an opportunity to help during the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan which killed more than 6000 people in the Philippines. Before then, I was only idling in my home town doing day to day, insignificant contribution to humanity where I think at that point was just normal. But upon seeing the situation on the ground (devastation due to the typhoon), inspired by OXFAM, I realized I could have done more by improving first myself. 
After working with OXFAM I’ve worked hard to advance my education and fortunately with the help of a scholarship( not OXFAM) I just recently finished my master’s degree in one of the top universities in my country. 
My point is, you can put behind bars, the concern people who’ve tarnished the reputation of OXFAM but do not generalize and do not judge the whole organization ‘cause by doing so , you’ll reduce the chances of unprivileged  people like me( who’ve touched by OXFAM works) in the future, to empower themselves and I am just one of the few.
Your donations were never wasted with OXFAM, most of the time OXFAM goes to remote areas to reach people affected by disasters where other organizations dared not to, due to its inaccessibility( danger, distance to main roads and etc.)",1

In short - Oxfam were taking on the message of Occupy.
Or: To quote former Charities Minister, Rob Wilson, they'd become -
""A front group for extreme leftwing Corbynistas'.

How convenient that this 'story' just as the Right Wing Media are demanding we stop sending money to 'Africa' because ""Charity begins at home"" - surely one of the most obscene bits of 'Selfishness parading as wisdom' ever voiced.

Yes, those who acted badly should be sacked (as they have been) and safeguards put in place(as they have been) but no-one is calling for this kind of oversight in any of the Businesses which make profits from Africa and which have a culture of sexual favours as part of their Executive - and lower - Hospitality. Oddly, in countries in which Sexual Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, there are no stories about the masses of white corporate employees who keep that industry afloat and NO calls for more safeguards and laws on this 'Free market' of women's bodies.
Don't you think there SHOULD be?

As Cimate Change increases, busineses buy up and evict whole populations, water is privatised and Oil Wars spread into everything, Oxfam - as well as all the other Charities -  are needed more now than ever.

DON'T let a Right-Wing campaign to take away Aid to countries which those of us in the '1st World' are STILL making a profit from just because they've managed to spin a 7-year old scandal into the engine for starving kids.

The Rich want to stop Charity. Everywhere.
We - surely - say - No.
Charity isn't a crime. Abuse is.

To ALL THOSE WHO WANT TO WITHDRAW FROM OXFAM, I ASK THEM TO FIRST STOP ARMING WARS, CIVIL-WARS, 'WAR-LORDS', ARMIES, GENERALS etc, etc, etc. THIS IS WHERE THE WORST ABUSE IS HAPPENING 24 / 7 /365.

THE WORST CRIMES - SEXUAL INCLUDED - AND INCLUDING MASS-RAPE IS BEING DONE BY ARMIES FUNDED AND 'TRAINED BY THE BRITISH, FRENCH, GERMANY, SWEDES, OTHER, EUROPEANS, AMERICANS, CHINESE, INDIANS, SOUTH AFRICANS, ISRAELIS, AUSTRALIANS etc who EXPORT ARMS TO PEOPLE WHO NEED FARMS AND PEACE.

OXFAM IS A SOFT-TARGET!  Once again, like with the problem with our Roman Catholic Church which was used to DELAY THE INEVITABLE the bigger sexual abuse issue is in society.  GET THE WORLD TO RE-FOCUS ON THE REAL ISSUE.

OXFAM's issue is horrible, THAT OUTSIDE OXFAM IS MUCH WORSE!  And it needs EVEN MORE MEDIA AND GLOBAL-ATTENTION THAN THAT BEEN WASTED ON ANOTHER SOFT-TARGET
