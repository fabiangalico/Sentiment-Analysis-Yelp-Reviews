# Sentiment-Analysis-Yelp-Reviews
The purpose of this study is to analyze the sentiment behind Yelp reviews for restaurants in the Las Vegas, Nevada area. We started by contructing our basetable from the data source (Yelp public dataset, Kaggle) and exploring the data using different methods. Then, we applied the dictionary-based lookup approach for sentiment analysis, and finally we ran different machine learning models, using the stars given for each review as the label for the dependient variable, and the words as the predictors. Finally, we evaluated the models and compared their performance.
